# Javascript Audio Visualizer
This is meant to be run locally as a backdrop to a party or something.

You can add a folder of songs (treated like a playlist), or individual songs and a queue will be built behind the scenes.

The mouse will disappear if it is idle, and you can change the color of the waves by clicking. The next song in the queue will auto play when the current song is finished.  If there are no more songs in the queue, it will stop playing.
